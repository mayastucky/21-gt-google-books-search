## Installation

Run npm install after cloning the repo. After everything has installed, run npm start and the application will render in your browser when loaded.

## Usage

This application uses the Google Book API, React, MongoDB, and Express to query the API and return searched books which can then be saved or deleted from the database. 

## Contributing

This was a solo project completed for homework for the Georgia Tech Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. As always, the world's biggest thank you goes out to our incredible TAs and my fabulous peers.
